                <h3>I Ride</h3>
                <p>I ride. The bike rides with me.<br>
                    I taste natures banquet and see her momentous sights.<br>
                    I feel her positive energy and experience her delights.<br>

                    Give me not the city halls, tapestries and climbing walls.<br>
                    They don't impress me any more.<br>
                    Keep your Timex watches, IPods and galoshes and instead give me<br>
                    ..... a lonesome prairie filled with the gal I love<br>
                    and a flight of startling white doves. (City Life vs Country)<br>

                    Tell me not to abide your politics, your religious nuts and your heretic's.<br>
                    Instead let me hear the voice, of my Song Of Choice,<br>
                    as the wind blows a tune that carries the voice of a lune<br>
                    across the water of a lake lit by beautiful full moon. (Terrorism vs Nature)<br>

                    I don't want your flavored drinks, your rotten egg smelling human race,<br>
                    nor the sound of your cries<br>
                    when you can't get your daily drug surprise.<br>
                    Nor your habits... bad most are ...from bedroom to the bar<br>
                    ....to wake with more then you can take<br>
                    ... a surprise ending with a wake. (Aids vs Common Sense)<br>

                    Wish me not your costume jewelry, makeup and tomfoolery.<br>
                    Clown for me no more with horrible fake laughter<br>
                    and daytime bore.<br>
                    You don't impress me.<br>
                    Speaking written words, written by others rather then your own<br>
                    ...that's the mark of a balloon<br>
                    ....hot wind from a buffoon. (TV)<br>

                    Don't sell me with your fear.<br>
                    Try to endanger falsely with your threats.<br>
                    Demand money for your pet....peeves.<br>
                    I don't think a reporter at a desk, knows the first thing<br>
                    about Terrorist Threats and certainly not the solution to Global War.<br>
                    Your opinion doesn't matter....not even Dan Rather. (Media News)<br>

                    Instead ...give me honor and integrity, generousness and forgiveness,<br>
                    and the ability to be more then otherwise I could be.<br>
                    Let me follow the path of morality,<br>
                    hard work with appreciation of natures generality<br>
                    and a gal who loves me .... just for me.<br>
                    I ride.<br>
                    Will you ride with me?<br>
